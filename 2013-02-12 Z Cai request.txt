2013-02-12, Zhonghou Cai has a request

He uses yviewer to convert MDA files to ASCII
and has relied on the support provided by the 
asciiRpt.py program from Ben-Chin.

host:  regulus
ARCH:  Solaris SPARC
uname: user2idd
pwd:   *******************

yviewer  -->
  /APSshare/epics/extensions_2007_07_31/bin/linux-x86-fc6 -->
  /home/beams8/USER2IDD/Yorick/asciiRpt.py

(note: peculiar since regulus is a Sun SPARC host)

Starting this run, for some unknown reason, 
the open file dialog stops showing directory contents
at directory depth of 4 or more.  
He can't select the data files he wants to convert.

example MDA and ASCII files are in directory below:
  /net/s2dserv/export/2-iddf/data12c3/Alix_NWU
  ./ASCII
  ./mda

He wants to regain this function.
The data files must be written in the same way as before.

example:
  2iddf_0001.mda 
  is a 1D scan
  produces a single text file
  2iddf_0001.1d.txt
  
  2iddf_0012.mda
  is a 2D scan with several (say N) detectors
  produces N text files, one per detector
  2iddf_0012.imD01.txt
  2iddf_0012.imD1.txt
  2iddf_0012.imD2.txt
  ...
  2iddf_0012.imDF.txt

The problem seems to happen on line 316 in the call to
tkFileDialog.askopenfilename()
How has this changed?

Perhaps a simple update of the widget tools 
might be all that is needed.
Otherwise, rebuild using contemporary tools,
reusing existing code if possible.
The GUI is simple.
